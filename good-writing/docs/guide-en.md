Good Chinese Writing Guide

Based on Paul Graham's "Good Writing," adapted for Chinese with insights from Yu Guangzhong and Wang Dingjun.


I. Core Thesis

Good writing has two meanings: it flows well, and the ideas are right.

These two are connected. Writing that flows well is more likely to be right.


II. Why Form and Content Are Linked

Reason 1: Shaking the Bin

When you fix an awkward sentence, you won't make it less true. Like shaking objects in a bin—they only pack tighter, never looser. Each revision improves the ideas.

Reason 2: The Writer Is the First Reader

Writing takes more reading than typing. You reread the same paragraph fifty, a hundred times. Smoother writing makes problems easier to spot. And the problems are usually in the thinking.

Reason 3: Rhythm Is the Shape of Ideas

Good rhythm isn't regular meter. It matches the ideas. Simple ideas get short sentences. Complex ideas need longer ones to unfold. When rhythm feels right, the ideas usually are.


III. What Makes Chinese "Flow"?

English flows through stress and syllables. Chinese flows through character count and breath.

Yu Guangzhong said: "Chinese is naturally concise. First-rate Chinese uses short sentences, few connectives, and varied tones."

Chinese flow has three layers:

Character Count Rhythm

3 characters: crisp
4 characters: smooth
5 characters: slower
7+ characters: starts to drag

Example:
「他走了」(3) — sharp
「他離開了」(4) — steady
「他終於走了」(5) — emotional
「他頭也不回地走了」(8) — getting heavy

Vary sentence length. Too many short sentences feel rushed. Too many long ones feel stuffy.

Breath

If you can read it aloud, the logic holds. If you run out of breath, the logic is tangled.

Wang Dingjun said: "Writing must be speakable. Unspeakable sentences have broken ideas."

Reading aloud is the most important test for Chinese writing.

Sentence Endings

In Chinese, the final character determines the sentence's energy.

Ending with a noun: stable
Ending with a verb: forceful
Ending with a particle: soft

「這是事實」is stronger than「這是事實的」
「他決定離開」is crisper than「他決定要離開了」


IV. Shaking the Bin in Chinese

English shakes the bin by adjusting sound. Chinese shakes by two methods:

Cutting Filler

Three consecutive「的」(de) = muddled thinking
「進行」「實施」「加以」(procedural verbs) = usually deletable
「非常」「十分」「相當」(intensifiers) = find a precise word instead

Every filler you cut forces you to rethink what you're actually saying.

Breaking Long Sentences

Over 30 characters in one sentence = probably two ideas crammed together. Split them and the thinking clarifies.

Original: 「由於天氣不好加上交通阻塞的關係，所以他沒有辦法準時抵達會場參加會議。」
(Because the weather was bad and traffic was jammed, he was unable to arrive at the venue on time to attend the meeting.)

Split: 「天氣差，路又塞。他遲到了。」
(Bad weather. Traffic jam. He was late.)

Splitting isn't just for readability. The process reveals: what I meant to say was this simple.


V. Chinese-Specific Checks

Read Aloud

Not silently. Out loud.
Mark where you stumble.
Stumbles are usually thinking problems, not word problems.

Count Characters

Sentences over 30 characters: check if splittable
Three consecutive「的」: check if deletable
Five+ sentences of same length: check rhythm

Listen to Endings

Too many「的」「了」「呢」at endings: writing goes soft
Too many「嗎」「吧」「啊」at endings: writing goes scattered
Use nouns or verbs to end sentences for structure

Cut Openings

「關於這個問題」(Regarding this issue)
「基本上來說」(Basically speaking)
「就我個人而言」(In my personal opinion)

These openings can usually be deleted entirely. Start with the point. The thinking will sharpen.


VI. Limitations

This method only applies to writing where ideas develop through the act of writing itself.

If you run an experiment first and then write a report, or if you're summarizing others' ideas, form and content aren't as tightly linked. The ideas live in the work, not the words.

But if you're thinking by writing—if writing is how you develop the ideas—then:

Making writing flow is making ideas right.

They're two ends of the same thing.


VII. Summary

Paul Graham said: If it looks good, it will fly well.

Chinese version: Writing that reads smoothly won't have bad ideas.

Not because smoothness guarantees correctness. But because pursuing smoothness forces you to get the ideas right.

Every filler cut is asking: what am I really trying to say?
Every sentence split is clarifying: how many ideas are here?
Every ending adjusted is deciding: what force should this land with?

Form is the shadow of content. If the shadow is crooked, the substance has a problem.


Appendix: Quick Checklist

□ Read aloud once, no stumbles
□ No sentences over 30 characters (unless intentional)
□ No three consecutive「的」
□ Sentence lengths vary
□ No throat-clearing openings
□ No consecutive particle endings (的、了、呢)
□ Checked「進行」「實施」「加以」— deleted what's deletable

Note on Using This as an AI Prompt

This guide is designed for checking Chinese output. Using the Chinese version (good-writing-zh.txt) as a prompt is more effective because:

1. The rules are Chinese-specific (e.g., "three consecutive 的" has no English equivalent)
2. The AI will check Chinese text against Chinese rules directly
3. Modern LLMs understand Chinese instructions as well as English ones

Use this English version for understanding the methodology, not as an operational prompt for Chinese writing tasks.
